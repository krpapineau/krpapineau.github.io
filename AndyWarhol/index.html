	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. 

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element

			<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
			<p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
			<p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</p>
			<p>This project invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

			<h3>So What is This Class About?</h3>
            
            
            <p>The Visual Communication course series introduces the technical and conceptual study of graphic design as a wide-ranging practice for the creation, reproduction, and dissemination of visual messages. Through sustained project work, students will investigate the ways that text and image can foster both positive and negative cultural representations as instruments of information, identification, and persuasion. Lectures, readings, and student research will supplement project work, introducing students to the concentrated disciplines of semiotics, visual rhetoric, typography and design history. Course work will include directed critiques and guided demonstrations and discussions, placing equal emphasis on concept (the design process), craft (composition and digital print production), and technical fluency (the understanding of software and digital media).</p>
            
            <p>In Visual Communication II, students explore these issues while developing fluency in creating images, animations and assets for the web, and understanding web-based languages and code. To successfully complete this course, students will be expected to demonstrate fluency with the formal (skill-based) and semantic (knowledge-based) strategies that have shaped graphic design practice throughout its modern and contemporary histories.</p>

			<h3>So What is This Project About?</h3>
            
            
            <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. This project aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>
            
            
			<p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

			<h3>Requirements</h3>
            
            
            <p>You may not edit the source <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> in any way; this requires you to create a root-level stylesheet by the name of &quot;style.css&quot;, and, of course, create a directory on your network drive with the name &quot;project2&quot;. Your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> may contain anything and everything to support the design of your project - including images. As you cannot edit the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, you must use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to introduce imagery in your project.  You do not need to test your site on all browsers. We will be viewing the projects on a combination of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari; your work must be viewable on these three browsers
