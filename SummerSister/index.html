            <h2>Who are we?</h2>

Summer Sister aims to recreate the quintessential, nostalgic camp experience for people of all ages, backgrounds, and identities, with musical performances, interactive tents, and art exhibits. </p>

        <h2>The Cause</h2>
        <p>Summer Sister is run in partnership with the Girls Rock Camp Alliance, supporting music programs for young women around the world. The GRCA is an international membership network of youth-centered arts and social justice organizations, providing resources and spaces for community building in order to build a strong movement for collective liberation. With youth music and arts programs losing funding, it is important to give young women access to specially funded programs and opportunities to promote creative expression and technical skills.</p>
